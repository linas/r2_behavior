@Vytas:
- /behavior/animation is current animation page, overwritten by state
- /behavior/attention is current attention page, overwritten by state
- /behavior/states/current_state_settings is current settings page, overwritten by state
- These three pages should be named similarly and contain some kind of disclaimer that it's useless to save them
- Maybe use one combined page per state. For some states that means only *-settings, but for others it's a combination of *-attention, *-animation and *-settings
